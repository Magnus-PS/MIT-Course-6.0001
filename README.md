# MIT-Course-6.0001
Intro to Computer Science and Programming in Python

While on-boarding as a Project Manager for a digital product company, I'd realized that I didn't have the proper technical toolbase to understand what our developers were working on and thus I set out to learn a bit more via practice. Doing the assignments from a renowned technical University (MIT) to build from this introductory level.

What had started as a couple hours a week of dedicated time and a very slow creep of progress through these assignments picked up steam late on and led to my finishing the last 2 problem sets (even though they were more complex) in a much quicker fashion. Dedicating more time, energy, and effort toward our pursuits usually reaps a similar result.

This was the first of what may be many Data Science courses.

To navigate, please use the following simple guide:

***Master Branch*** for corresponding assignments and lessons learned.
***Problem set branches (ie. PS-001-code)*** for corresponding code, supplement code, and txt files.
